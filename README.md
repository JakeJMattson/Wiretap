# Wiretap
<p align="justify">
Wiretap provides a way for the staff of a Discord server to monitor a target user's server activity from a single channel.
It was made for large servers, but can be used at any scale.
Consider the following: A user joins your server and says something concerning or perhaps breaks server rules.
How do you make sure they stay in line? Do you set a reminder to check their history every few minutes? 
Do you hope that staff is watching every channel? Wiretap solves this.
</p>

### How does it work?
<p align="justify">
First, you track a target user - a private text channel is created on the server automatically.
Now, all you have to do is wait.
If the user sends a message in any channel throughout the server, it will be logged in their private channel.
Now your staff can quickly and easily review a user through a single channel without the extra work or hassle.
